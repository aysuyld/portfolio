### Dissertation
Thesis Project: Sentiment Analysis of IMDB Reviews
This thesis project was conducted through collaboration between 
myself and two of my friends. The aim of the project is to develop a 
sentiment analysis model to determine whether user reviews on the 
IMDB platform are positive or negative. In this project, we adopted an 
artificial neural network-based approach using popular Python 
libraries such as Keras, Matplotlib, and NumPy. Our thesis project was 
accomplished through collaboration and teamwork. The successful 
outcomes of the project and our data science skills continue to 
motivate us for future projects. Additionally, I believe that this project 
has provided us with opportunities to further advance in areas such 
as data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning.

### Career Goal
My career goal is to specialize in the field of data science and work 
effectively on data analysis and machine learning projects using 
languages such as Python and SQL. I am focused on continuous 
learning and gaining practical experience to improve and deepen 
my skills in this field.
In my career, I will continue to stay updated on new technologies and 
strive to improve myself to become a leading professional in the field 
of data science. I will keep track of the latest trends in data science 
and analytics to deepen my knowledge and skills, and to provide 
innovative solutions in the field of data analytics. In line with my goals, 
I aim to participate in successful projects in the industry, join relevant 
communities, and contribute to knowledge sharing.
I aspire to contribute value by participating in data science and 
analytics projects with teams I collaborate with. With strong 
communication skills, analytical mindset, and a willingness to learn, I 
aim to achieve success by staying updated on developments in the 
field of data science and applying them effectively.

### Profile
My name is Aysu Yıldız, and I graduated from Kütahya Dumlupınar 
University with a degree in Computer Engineering. With the 
knowledge and experience I gained in my field, I am particularly 
skilled in organizing, reducing, presenting, analyzing, and interpreting 
data using Python. I manage modeling processes by applying 
preprocessing to the data, validating the training set, detecting 
errors, and generating predictions based on the models I develop.
Over the past year, I have further developed myself in the field of 
data science through the trainings I have received and the projects I 
have worked on. I have conducted in-depth studies, especially in 
Natural Language Processing (NLP), TensorFlow, and Machine 
Learning. During this process, I worked on projects such as Leaf 
Disease Detection, Chatbot, Image Classification, Cancer and Heart 
Attack Detection, and conducted small-scale analyses with Kaggle 
datasets.
Additionally, I have gained experience with tools and platforms such 
as FastAPI, Flask Server, Azure, and GCP. I am proficient in connecting 
to databases and performing observations using SQL queries. This 
skill enables me to make decisions based on the results obtained and 
to effectively utilize the data. I am team-oriented, have problemsolving skills, and have an open-minded approach to continuous 
learning
